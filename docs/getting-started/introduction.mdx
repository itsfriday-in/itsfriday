## Developer-First Docs

This documentation is focused on engineers integrating and extending APILens.

Current scope:

- authentication flows
- telemetry ingest contracts
- analytics and endpoint APIs
- SDK implementation guidance
- engineering notes and architecture

## Product Model

- **User**: Authenticated account that owns one or more apps
- **App**: Top-level tenant-scoped workspace for API monitoring
- **Environment**: Deployment context inside an app (prod/staging/dev/custom)
- **Endpoint**: Method + path pair auto-detected from ingest traffic
- **Consumer**: Request source derived from telemetry metadata

## What You Can Build

- backend SDKs and middleware for ingest
- internal API dashboards and observability workflows
- high-volume endpoint analytics pipelines

## Coming Soon

Consumer/user-facing documentation will be published separately. This portal remains dev-centric for now.

## Next Steps

1. Read [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)
2. Review [Architecture](/getting-started/architecture)
3. Integrate [Ingest API](/ingest/ingest-api)
4. Build against [REST API](/api-reference/rest-api)
