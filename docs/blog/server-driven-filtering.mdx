title: 'Server-Driven Filtering at Scale'
description: 'Why APILens moved endpoint filtering and pagination to backend queries with safe cache in frontend.'
---

## Context

Endpoint analytics started with client-side filtering for fast iteration. As data volume grows, that model degrades quickly.

## What Changed

APILens now uses:

- backend-driven filters, sorting, and pagination
- endpoint options API for filter dropdowns
- short-lived bounded cache on frontend for responsive UX

## Why This Works

- predictable query cost at high cardinality
- no giant payload transfer for table interaction
- consistent behavior across search/sort/page states

## Key Principle

Use client cache for speed, backend queries for truth.
