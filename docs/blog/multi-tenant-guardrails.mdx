## Tenant Boundaries

APILens applies app-scoped checks at every layer:

- JWT-authenticated app routes resolve app ownership by `app_slug`
- API-key ingest resolves tenant context from key
- analytics queries always bind `app_id`

## Security Posture

- no cross-tenant route access by design
- no ingest without valid app-scoped key
- no analytics outside app-bound filters

## Operational Advice

For contributors, treat app scope as a non-optional invariant in services and query builders.
